# Python-Pandas
Pandas is an open-source library in Python that is mainly used for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series.Pandas is fast and has high performance & productivity for user.
Pandas generally provide two data structures for manipulating data, They are: Series and DataFrame. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. Pandas is used in conjunction with other libraries that are used for data science. The data produced by Pandas are often used as input for plotting functions of Matplotlib, statistical analysis in SciPy, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.
Here is a list of things that we can do using Pandas:

1. Data set cleaning, merging, and joining.

2. Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.

3. Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects.

4. Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.

5. Data Visualization
